= Demo: =

We have a comprehensive showcase of the shortcode’s design and functionality on our [Demonstration Website](https://demo.designextreme.com/reviews-rating-google-business/).

= Requirements: =

*   A free [Google API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and a [Place ID](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id). Specific locations are supported; coverage areas are no longer offering data through the API.
*   A [Google Billing Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to receive your *substantial and free* API Request allocation.

= Recommendations: =

*   Please [set your business in Google](https://business.google.com) and find your Business’ [Place ID](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id) before using this plugin.
*   For peace of mind, please set [Google Places API Quotas](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/apis/places-backend.googleapis.com/quotas) to keep requests below the billable threshold. Recommended value for requests is 100 per day.

*This is my first public plugin, so [all comments](https://designextreme.com/wordpress/) are very welcome. I would also like to see your usage so I can introduce new themes. There is a sister plugin: [We’re Open!](https://wordpress.org/plugins/opening-hours/) which retrieves current opening hours from Google Business.*

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/g-business-reviews-rating` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress
3. Use the **Settings**→**Reviews and Rating – Google My Business** screen to configure the plugin with your Google API Key and the business’ Place ID
4. Once the Google Credentials are set, available shortcodes will be available to place in any page, post or use the widget


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get a Google API Key? =

All the details for collecting your Google API Key can be found at: [Google API Key Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).

Once your *Project* is set, you will need a new *API Key* with access to the **Places API**. As a restriction, set your host’s **IP Address** (not your website’s URL). Details of this value are listed in the Settings→Reviews and Rating page.

The Google API is required for this plugin to load the data from the Google API.

= How do I find my Place ID? =

You can location your unique *Place ID* using Google’s: [Place ID Finder](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id)

= I have more than 5 reviews, why can I only see 5 in this plugin? =

The Google API only offers a maximum of 5 relevant reviews at a time. Fortunately, this plugin will collect more reviews over time giving you more options to display your own selection of reviews from a larger pool. If you feel comfortable with the *HTML Inspector* in your browser, you can import all the reviews showing in the Google reviews popup.

= Why can’t I see any reviews on the website? =

Your first place to check is the *Retrieved Data* tab in Dashboard→Settings. If there is an error here, follow the advice offered by the Google API. If you can see some reviews listed, check for restrictions in your settings or shortcode that may limit the results. You can use the parameter: *errors=1* to report back potential issues in the front-end.

= I retrieved some reviews, but now an error message is asking for an “active billing account”. What can I do to see my reviews again? =

To use this plugin over time, you’ll need multiple requests to the Place API. Accounts without billing details have a tiny initial allocation. So, please [enable billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing/enable) to receive your substantial and free API request allocation.

= Why does this require a Google Billing Account if it’s *free?* =

The link to a [Google Billing Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/project/_/billing/enable) is Google’s way of preventing overuse of its APIs – prolific users will be billed according. Fortunately, this plugin will use a tiny fraction of your inclusive free allowance; so it is free to use.

= Getting my own Google API is annoying; can’t I just load my reviews from somewhere else? =

This is possible; however it would involve sharing your data with a third-party provider. We believe that it is much better to source your reviews direct from Google. Additionally, relying on anyone other than Google will result in slower updates and/or fewer reviews with the possibility of being cut-off their service goes down or if they decide to limit their service to reduce costs.

= When setting up the Google API Credentials, I cannot see Places API listed. Where is it? =

Some people don’t appear to have the Places API enabled in their account. Go to your [Places API page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/places-backend.googleapis.com?q=place) and click to Enable this API. 

= I can see my reviews in Google, but nothing is appearing in the plugin. The Google API and Place ID are valid. What is happening? =

Google does not send data for all places; only those currently found using the [Place ID Finder](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id). Some people who have service or coverage areas that aren’t a specific area may receive an error message: Not Found when attempting to retrieve data. This may occur after a period of time has passed. Unfortunately, there is nothing to remedy this issue for the time-being, other than to ensure your business uses a specific location as its Place ID.

= I don’t have any reviews yet, how can I develop my new website without any data to preview? =

There’s a demo mode that will populate some reviews for you and allow for testing prior to going live.

= Where can I find some examples of the shortcodes? =

There’s a comprehensive list in the Shortcodes tab in Dashboard→Settings. To view a showcase of many of these shortcodes with various parameters and some suggestions for CSS, please have a look at our [Demonstration Website](https://demo.designextreme.com/reviews-rating-google-business/).
